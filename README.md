# Mocha-Chai-Tester
Learning how to test with Mocha and Chai

## My tests passed!

I figured out how to make my tests pass, including a test that determines if a file exists or not. Which was tricky because at first I thought I had a false positive. After some finicking with it and googling a bit, I found out how to use fs to determine if a file exists or not.

## My tests failed!

Just as important as passing is failing. Or else I won't know for sure if my functions and my tests are correct. Fail === pass.
